# AI Artificial Neuron
Explains how an artificial neuron works, learns, and how its activation function operates.
 
The details of the source code and explanation are in the document [AI_Artificial_Neuron.pdf](https://github.com/Gonz3d/AI_Artificial_Neuron/blob/main/AI_Artificial_Neuron.pdf) 
 
The `Network_P01` and `Network_P11` folders contain neural network implementations, with input and output probability values ranging from [0, 1] and [-1, 1], respectively.

 The code samples require the MNIST dataset, which can be obtained from:[https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
